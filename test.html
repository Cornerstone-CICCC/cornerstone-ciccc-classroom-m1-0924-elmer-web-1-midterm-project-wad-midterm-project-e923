                                    As a Telecommunications Engineer, I had the opportunity to participate in challenging and unique projects for well-known companies. 
                                    These projects helped me to acquire the expertise and knowledge to understand the tech world.

                                    My creative side led me to explore new areas in technology, and a love story between Web Design, coding, and I was born. Since that moment,
                                    I have been working on projects to develop new skills, mainly by self-studying, for all minds and interests.

                                    A passion doesn't have to be part of your income necessarily. You enjoy it. That is what photography is to me. A way to express myself, 
                                    capture unique moments, and travel in time whenever I see my pictures.
